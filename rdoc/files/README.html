<h2>Revision History</h2>
<pre>
  - original 7/21/06 by Paul Legato (plegato@nks.net)
  - Revised 7/22/06 by Paul Legato (plegato@nks.net)
</pre>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Soda Search is a medium-performance full-text indexing system. It is
loosely based on the same principles as Xapian (<a
href="http://www.xapian.org">www.xapian.org</a>/).
</p>
<p>
The system is relatively simple. It consists of two database tables per
class being indexed, plus some ActiveRecord extensions shared by all
classes that use the Indexer.
</p>
<p>
The database tables are deliberately NOT normalized completely, to cut back
on the computational overhead required to do searches and updates.
</p>
<p>
This system is quite useable as it is, but the index format it provides is
also the foundation for a much more robust searching system. We will
eventually implement phrase matching, term weighting, Boolean term
combination, etc. This can all be accomplished with the current index
format; all that needs to be done is modify the searching code.
</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
Install this directory into your vendor/plugins/ directory.
</p>
<p>
The required tables per indexed class are &lt;class&gt;_terms and
&lt;class&gt;_indices, where &lt;class&gt; is the name of your model class.
</p>
<h3>&lt;class&gt;_terms structure:</h3>
<pre>
    id primary key,
    term text not null uniq

    Index on term.
</pre>
<h3>&lt;class&gt;_indices structure:</h3>
<pre>
    id primary key,
    term_id int not null FK references &lt;class&gt;_terms(id)
    position int not null,
    owner uuid not null FK references users(id), -- not normal
    public boolean not null default false, -- not normal
    indexee_id uuid not null FK references &lt;class&gt;(id)

    Index on term_id.
</pre>
<p>
You are responsible for creating these tables, and for creating
ActiveRecord classes for them. When you call acts_as_soda_search in
whatever you are indexing, pass these two classes to it.
</p>
<p>
You must implement two ActiveRecord model classes (one for each newly
created table), and pass the Class objects to acts_as_soda_search:
indices_class and terms_class.
</p>
<p>
We hope to add a migration generator for these items in the future. If you
would write one and contribute it back to the project, we&#8217;d
appreciate it!
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Read this, and read the comments in acts_as_soda_search.rb. We hope to have
better docs here soon. Please feel free to contribute patches with
improvements to this documentation.
</p>
<h2>Consequences of Not Being Normal</h2>
<p>
The two not-normal fields (owner and public) would normally be retrieved
via a join on &lt;class&gt;_id to the original &lt;class&gt; table, but we
don&#8217;t do this so that we can avoid touching the &lt;class&gt; table
altogether when we are only interested in searching for things owned by a
certain user, or for things marked public (to implement public vs. private
searches.) The names of the index tables also encode important data (i.e.
which class is being indexed), for speed.
</p>
<p>
The flipside is that it is possible for the data here to become
outdated/corrupted if the owner of a &lt;class&gt; instance changes, or if
the public status of an item changes.
</p>
<p>
Both of these situations can be taken care of by adding triggers on the
referenced table that propagates such updates to the &lt;class&gt;_indices
table. A less painful method, albeit one that does not ensure integrity at
the database level, is to handle this with ActiveRecord model hooks; such a
setup is &quot;wrong&quot; insofar as a database schema should not allow
for the possibility that it even can become corrupted - it should be
impossible to put any situation into the database that would be corrupt by
definition. Database level triggers do that, AR hooks don&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>
ActiveRecord::Base is extended with an index() method. This returns an
Array of terms present in the object in order. How to determine what terms
to include is up to each object.
</p>
<p>
The ordering (held inherently in the Array at the Ruby level, and held in
the &quot;position&quot; column at the database level) is used so that when
users do searches, terms close together can be given more weight than terms
farther apart. This method will allow quoted exact phrase searches, once
those are implemented in the retrieval code.
</p>
<p>
ActiveRecord::Base also gets two class methods, reindex() and search().
</p>
<h2>Blunt Reindexing</h2>
<h3>Of a whole class:</h3>
<p>
To reindex a given class, call &lt;class name&gt;.reindex(&lt;type&gt;),
e.g. &quot;Comments.reindex(:all)&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Currently valid types are :all and :unindexed.
</p>
<p>
:all erases all existing indices and reindexes every record. This can take
a long time if there are a lot of records to be reindexed, and it will put
significant load on the database while this is happening.
</p>
<p>
:unindexed just indexes records that have no index data stored in the
database. Note that any partially indexed records will NOT be completed by
running :unindexed, since the test is a simple Boolean check.
</p>
<h3>Of one instance of a class:</h3>
<p>
Instances are provided with an &quot;index()&quot; instance method.
</p>
<p>
The first argument, what_to_index, is an array. It can be either an array
of strings or of procs. In the string version, the strings are the text to
be indexed.
</p>
<p>
In the proc version, each proc is called in sequence. It may return either
a <a href="../classes/String.html">String</a> or another Proc (which should
return a <a href="../classes/String.html">String</a>). Currently, only 2
levels of proc nesting are supported &#8212; someday, we&#8217;ll rewrite
it to be infinitely recursive (although Ruby as of now has tail recursion
stack issues.)
</p>
<p>
The second argument, clear_old, is an optional Boolean that defaults to
false. If set to true, it will erase all entries for the instance before
indexing what_to_index and inserting it. Use this only when the app is
running in single-user mode (i.e. during a maintenance window, from the
console.) If you run it while in multi-user mode, there is a small chance
that there is another thread somewhere which will start a transaction to
insert data into the index after/during the transaction that clears the old
data. This could potentially corrupt the database through a race condition.
</p>
<p>
For example, a website user adds a new comment to a thread in a forum.
(Assume that for some reason the thread is indexed as a whole.) The app
code auto-indexes the new message and adds it to the database in
Transaction A. A half-second before that, you start up an index() on the
thread with :clear_old == true, initiating Transaction B. B is given the
contents of the message as its first argument, which was created before A
committed. It deletes the old data from the index and writes new index data
for the messages it knows about, which do not include the page added in A.
The new index will thus not include any data from A.
</p>
<p>
There may be other scenarios. We can abate this through locking at either
the database or app level. Serialized transactions would work too, but the
app must know to retry them. This is still a TODO. For now, only do
:clear_old == true in a maintenance window, or risk doom.
</p>

for more information.
</p>
<h2>Advanced Reindexing</h2>
<p>
Suppose that part of a large indexed object changes; for example, one
message in a thread which is indexed as a whole is changed. We have added a
subsource_url text field to the index, so that individual chunks of index
data can be referenced independently of one another according to whatever
scheme makes sense in your case.
